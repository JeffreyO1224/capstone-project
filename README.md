# capstone-project
Repository for our Hunter College CSCI Capstone course project

To run our project, run npm i and then npm run dev in our front-end folder,
do the same for our back-end folder to run the backend,
and start a uvicorn backend to expose our model API.

Model weights were not included in our repository as they were too large for gitHub
